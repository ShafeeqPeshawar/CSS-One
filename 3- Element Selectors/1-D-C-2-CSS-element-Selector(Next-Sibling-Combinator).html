CSS Combinators

    A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
    A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. 
    Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
    
    There are four different combinators in CSS:

    1- Descendant combinator (space)
    2- Child combinator (>)
    3- Next sibling combinator (+)
    4- Subsequent-sibling combinator (~)




    Next Sibling Combinator (+)
    
    -The next sibling combinator is used to select an element that is directly after 
    another specific element.

    -Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means 
    "immediately following".
