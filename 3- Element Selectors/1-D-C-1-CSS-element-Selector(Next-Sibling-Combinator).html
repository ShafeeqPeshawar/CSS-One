CSS Combinators

    A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
    A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. 
    Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
    
    There are four different combinators in CSS:

    1- Descendant combinator (space)
    2- Child combinator (>)
    3- Next sibling combinator (+)
    4- Subsequent-sibling combinator (~)




    Next Sibling Combinator (+)
    
    -The next sibling combinator is used to select an element that is directly after 
    another specific element.

    -Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means 
    "immediately following".

    The following example selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately 
    after <div> elements:
    and 
    selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <h2> elements:

 -->



 <html>

 <style>

    div + p {
        background-color: rgb(58, 86, 245);
      }

    h2 + p {
        background-color: rgb(5, 158, 38);
      }
      
    </style>
