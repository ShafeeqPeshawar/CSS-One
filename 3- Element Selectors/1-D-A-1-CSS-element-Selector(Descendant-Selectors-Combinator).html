CSS Combinators

    A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
    A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. 
    Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
    
    There are four different combinators in CSS:

    1- Descendant combinator (space)
    2- Child combinator (>)
    3- Next sibling combinator (+)
    4- Subsequent-sibling combinator (~)




    Descendant Combinator
    
    The descendant combinator matches all elements that are descendants of a specified 
    element.

    The following example selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements:

 <html>

 <style>

    div  p {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
    </style>
