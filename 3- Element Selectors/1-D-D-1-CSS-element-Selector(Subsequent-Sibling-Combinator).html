CSS Combinators

    A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
    A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. 
    Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
    
    There are four different combinators in CSS:

    1- Descendant combinator (space)
    2- Child combinator (>)
    3- Next sibling combinator (+)
    4- Subsequent-sibling combinator (~)




    Subsequent-sibling Combinator (~)

    he subsequent-sibling combinator selects all elements that are next siblings of a 
    specified element.

    The following example selects all <p> elements that are next siblings of <div> elements: 
    and
    The following example selects all <p> elements that are next siblings of <h2> elements:

      }
