CSS Combinators

    A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
    A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. 
    Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
    
    There are four different combinators in CSS:

    1- Descendant combinator (space)
    2- Child combinator (>)
    3- Next sibling combinator (+)
    4- Subsequent-sibling combinator (~)




    Child Combinator (>)

    The child combinator selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

    The following example selects all <p> elements that are children of a <div> element:
