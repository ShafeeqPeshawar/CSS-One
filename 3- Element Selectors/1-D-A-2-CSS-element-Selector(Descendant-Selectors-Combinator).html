CSS Combinators

    A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
    A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. 
    Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
    
    There are four different combinators in CSS:

    1- Descendant combinator (space)
    2- Child combinator (>)
    3- Next sibling combinator (+)
    4- Subsequent-sibling combinator (~)




    Descendant Combinator
    
    The descendant combinator matches all elements that are descendants of a specified 
    element.

    The following example selects all the classes a2 inside class b1 elements:

 <html>

 <style>

    .b1  .a2 {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
    </style>
 

    <div class="b1">
        <h2 class="a1"> We will learn HTML</h2>
        <p class="a2"> we will also learn CSS</p>
        <p class="a3"> Will do some practical implementations</p>
        <p class="a2"> We will do clientSide scripting in Javascript </p>
        <h2 class="a4"> and project at the end</h3>
        <span class="a5">
            <p class="a6"> The duration of the course is 2 weeks </p>
            <p class="a6"> The duration of the course is 2 weeks </p>
        </span>
    </div>
        <p class="a7"> Training location: Oxford Street  </p>
        <p class="a2"> Manchester </p>
